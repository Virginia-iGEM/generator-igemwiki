**William E. Bentley** is a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland and the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering. Since his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research.
