## Postcard Exchange

We participated in this year's postcard exchange by [Düesseldorf](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf)! Here's the postcard that we created:

This year, Team Düsseldorf held a postcard exchange event for iGEM teams in order to promote synthetic biology in public using postcards designed by different iGEM teams. Each participating team designs their own postcard and exchanges it with other participating teams so every team can collect postcards from all over the world.

This year, we participated in the event and did the postcard exchange with 50 other participating schools. The word cloud on our postcard was generated from project descriptions scraped from all the 2018 iGEM wiki pages, and the shape of it is the UVA Rotunda, the spiritual symbol of Thomas Jefferson’s University.

## Richard Montgomery High School (RMHS) 

We were fortunate enough to collaborate and mentor [RMHS](http://2018.igem.org/Team:RMHS_Maryland), a high school team whose project is very similar to ours. Since they are in close collaboration with the University of Maryland, they were able to give us PCT6, which is an integral part of our project. We were able to help RMHS with various aspects of their project, including the wiki, wetlab techniques, human practices, and modeling.  

## Mid-Atlantic Meetup

We participated in the [Mid-Atlantic Meetup](http://2018.igem.org/Team:UMaryland/meetup) hosted by the University of Maryland iGEM team! We learned a lot about other teams' projects and also got feedback about our project from our peers.
